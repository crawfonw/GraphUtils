GraphUtils
==========

Python package implementing various graph structures and operations.

This is not intended to be an industrial-grade library, but rather an easily extendible code base for educational purposes.

Many of the algorithms are modeled after their presentations in [Heuristic Search: Theory and Applications (1st ed.)](http://books.google.com/books?id=3k5MVjKzBP4C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false "Google Books") by Edelkamp and Schroedl.
